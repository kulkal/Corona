Nsight Aftermath is primarily a development tool and is intended to be used
with minimal side effects to the user application. Despite this, there may be
overhead when it is enabled resulting in performance degradation. The
application should only fully enable Nsight Aftermath when in an application
controlled 'diagnostics mode', e.g. enabled after the user has experienced a
GPU crash and exhaustive data collection is required.

Your users should also be able to easily disable Nsight Aftermath in situations
where performance is critical, such as when benchmarking or during competitive
play.

To override the behavior of applications that do not follow the above guidelines
a user may always set a Windows registry key that forces off all Aftermath
functionality in the application:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\NVIDIA Corporation\Nsight Aftermath\ForceOff=1.
